# Absolute-Differences-in-2-n-Sized-Sets

 If there is a 2^n-sided polygon with natural numbers on its vertices, then after taking the absolute value difference between two adjacent vertices for all sides up to x number of times, where x is the largest natural number on a vertex or is equal to 2^n if and only if 2^n is greater than all of the values on the vertices, all vertices will have the number zero on them. If one places all of these numbers in a set and performs the same operation on them, the same outcome will occur -- all positions in the set will equal to zero.
